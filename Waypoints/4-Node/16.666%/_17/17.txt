This example has 4 nodes.
There are 2 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 3): (2, 0), (3, 1): (3, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 1, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3")
