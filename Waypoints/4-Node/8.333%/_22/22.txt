This example has 4 nodes.
There are 1 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 2): (1, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 2, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3")
