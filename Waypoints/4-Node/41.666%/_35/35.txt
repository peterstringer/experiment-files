This example has 4 nodes.
There are 5 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 1): (0, 3), (2, 0): (2, 3), (3, 2): (3, 1), (2, 1): (2, 3), (2, 3): (2, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 3, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3")
