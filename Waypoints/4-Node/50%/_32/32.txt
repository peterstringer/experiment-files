This example has 4 nodes.
There are 6 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 0): (3, 3), (1, 3): (1, 2), (1, 2): (1, 0), (0, 3): (0, 0), (3, 1): (3, 0), (1, 0): (1, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 1, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3")
