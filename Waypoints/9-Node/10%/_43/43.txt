This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 4), (4, 0): (4, 3), (3, 6): (3, 4), (7, 6): (7, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 7, 2, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
