This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 4): (5, 7), (7, 3): (7, 2), (1, 0): (1, 1), (5, 7): (5, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 2, 7, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
