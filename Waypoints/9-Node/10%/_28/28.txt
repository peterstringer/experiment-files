This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 8): (5, 5), (2, 4): (2, 7), (4, 6): (4, 0), (2, 1): (2, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 2, 6, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
