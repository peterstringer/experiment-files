This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 1): (4, 0), (0, 4): (0, 8), (8, 7): (8, 6), (8, 4): (8, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 7, 4, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
