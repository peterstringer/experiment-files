This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 7): (6, 5), (7, 8): (7, 0), (0, 1): (0, 2), (8, 7): (8, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 4, 1, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
