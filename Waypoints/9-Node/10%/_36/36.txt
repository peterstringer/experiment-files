This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 3), (1, 5): (1, 4), (7, 5): (7, 0), (4, 3): (4, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 6, 2, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
