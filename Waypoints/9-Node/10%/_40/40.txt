This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 3): (1, 5), (8, 5): (8, 4), (3, 7): (3, 2), (5, 7): (5, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 1, 7, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
