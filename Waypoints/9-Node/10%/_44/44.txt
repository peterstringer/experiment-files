This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 6): (7, 7), (4, 8): (4, 3), (2, 1): (2, 8), (5, 2): (5, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 3, 7, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
