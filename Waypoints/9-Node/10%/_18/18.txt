This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 7): (8, 3), (4, 6): (4, 3), (2, 5): (2, 8), (6, 4): (6, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 8, 4, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
