This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 4): (0, 7), (1, 4): (1, 0), (3, 0): (3, 8), (2, 4): (2, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 6, 3, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
