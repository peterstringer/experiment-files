This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 3): (0, 4), (0, 4): (0, 5), (5, 1): (5, 2), (3, 6): (3, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 2, 8, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
