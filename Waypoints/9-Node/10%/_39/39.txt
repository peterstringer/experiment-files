This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 7): (3, 2), (1, 0): (1, 5), (5, 8): (5, 2), (3, 0): (3, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 8, 6, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
