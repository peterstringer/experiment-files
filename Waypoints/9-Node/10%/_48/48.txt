This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 7): (5, 4), (4, 2): (4, 0), (1, 0): (1, 3), (4, 6): (4, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 8, 1, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
