This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 7): (4, 5), (3, 6): (3, 3), (1, 3): (1, 8), (4, 2): (4, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 1, 4, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
