This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 6): (7, 2), (7, 3): (7, 6), (1, 4): (1, 2), (4, 7): (4, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 1, 2, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
