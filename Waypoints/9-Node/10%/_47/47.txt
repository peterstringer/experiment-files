This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 2): (5, 4), (2, 4): (2, 2), (3, 1): (3, 2), (8, 7): (8, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 5, 1, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
