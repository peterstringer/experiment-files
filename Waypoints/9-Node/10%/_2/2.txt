This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 1): (3, 8), (8, 5): (8, 6), (4, 6): (4, 5), (4, 7): (4, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 3, 4, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
