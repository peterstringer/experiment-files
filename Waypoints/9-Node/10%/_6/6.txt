This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 8): (5, 3), (7, 5): (7, 7), (4, 6): (4, 3), (0, 1): (0, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 6, 3, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
