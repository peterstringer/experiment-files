This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 4): (7, 1), (7, 8): (7, 6), (8, 5): (8, 0), (4, 1): (4, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 7, 5, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
