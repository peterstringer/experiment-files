This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 3): (6, 2), (2, 5): (2, 1), (7, 5): (7, 8), (3, 6): (3, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 5, 4, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
