This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 8): (4, 6), (6, 4): (6, 6), (1, 2): (1, 6), (2, 4): (2, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 4, 8, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
