This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 7): (8, 6), (4, 2): (4, 7), (3, 0): (3, 4), (7, 5): (7, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 8, 7, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
