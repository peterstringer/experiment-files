This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 2): (1, 5), (1, 3): (1, 6), (1, 5): (1, 0), (6, 7): (6, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 1, 4, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
