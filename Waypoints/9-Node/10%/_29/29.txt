This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 1): (4, 0), (2, 1): (2, 2), (8, 4): (8, 5), (7, 3): (7, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 3, 5, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
