This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 1): (3, 3), (7, 3): (7, 2), (0, 4): (0, 1), (4, 5): (4, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 8, 2, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
