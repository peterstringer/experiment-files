This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 3): (7, 8), (8, 4): (8, 8), (1, 0): (1, 6), (4, 3): (4, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 4, 3, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
