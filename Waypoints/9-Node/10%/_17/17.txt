This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 0): (3, 4), (7, 5): (7, 4), (2, 1): (2, 2), (5, 2): (5, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 1, 3, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
