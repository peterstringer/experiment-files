This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 5): (4, 4), (5, 2): (5, 6), (8, 7): (8, 3), (8, 5): (8, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 1, 3, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
