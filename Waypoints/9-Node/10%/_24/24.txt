This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 4): (8, 3), (1, 5): (1, 3), (2, 1): (2, 0), (0, 1): (0, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 4, 5, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
