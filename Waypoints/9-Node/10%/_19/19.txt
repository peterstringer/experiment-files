This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 5): (7, 4), (7, 8): (7, 5), (5, 1): (5, 3), (8, 5): (8, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 8, 6, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
