This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 4): (5, 5), (5, 8): (5, 6), (1, 4): (1, 2), (1, 0): (1, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 2, 6, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
