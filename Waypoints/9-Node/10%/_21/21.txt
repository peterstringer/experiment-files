This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 3): (1, 7), (4, 6): (4, 7), (1, 2): (1, 4), (7, 6): (7, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 6, 4, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
