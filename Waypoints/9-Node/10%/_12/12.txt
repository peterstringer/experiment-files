This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 4): (2, 7), (0, 4): (0, 2), (5, 1): (5, 7), (1, 0): (1, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 8, 5, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
