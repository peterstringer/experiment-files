This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 4): (8, 5), (4, 0): (4, 7), (7, 6): (7, 4), (1, 2): (1, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 4, 7, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
