This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 5): (1, 3), (3, 0): (3, 1), (5, 4): (5, 2), (1, 3): (1, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 7, 6, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
