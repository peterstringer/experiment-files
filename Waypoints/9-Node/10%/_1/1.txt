This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 4): (3, 0), (2, 1): (2, 3), (2, 5): (2, 4), (0, 4): (0, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 1, 2, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
