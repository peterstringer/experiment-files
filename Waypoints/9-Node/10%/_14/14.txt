This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 5): (2, 4), (2, 4): (2, 5), (3, 6): (3, 4), (5, 2): (5, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
