This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 3): (1, 5), (8, 7): (8, 0), (1, 0): (1, 6), (6, 3): (6, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 5, 7, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
