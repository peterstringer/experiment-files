This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 6): (7, 4), (7, 5): (7, 2), (4, 3): (4, 1), (1, 3): (1, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 3, 5, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
