This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 5): (2, 3), (3, 1): (3, 8), (1, 5): (1, 3), (7, 8): (7, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 4, 8, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
