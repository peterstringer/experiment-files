This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 5), (5, 1): (5, 6), (4, 1): (4, 6), (0, 3): (0, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 3, 7, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
