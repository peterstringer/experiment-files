This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 4): (7, 0), (4, 0): (4, 3), (0, 1): (0, 2), (6, 3): (6, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 1, 7, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
