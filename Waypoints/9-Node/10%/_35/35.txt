This example has 9 nodes.
There are 4 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 5): (2, 0), (8, 4): (8, 6), (4, 5): (4, 1), (7, 3): (7, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 1, 8, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
