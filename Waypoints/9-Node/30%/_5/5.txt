This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 5): (2, 8), (6, 4): (6, 8), (7, 3): (7, 6), (4, 5): (4, 2), (3, 7): (3, 0), (4, 7): (4, 3), (3, 6): (3, 4), (3, 0): (3, 5), (4, 1): (4, 6), (6, 3): (6, 6), (5, 8): (5, 2), (1, 2): (1, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 4, 6, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
