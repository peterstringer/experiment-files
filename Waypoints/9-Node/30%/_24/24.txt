This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 2): (5, 3), (4, 6): (4, 4), (5, 1): (5, 6), (7, 8): (7, 1), (4, 3): (4, 1), (7, 5): (7, 3), (8, 7): (8, 5), (3, 4): (3, 7), (6, 7): (6, 8), (5, 4): (5, 6), (1, 3): (1, 4), (1, 2): (1, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 7, 5, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
