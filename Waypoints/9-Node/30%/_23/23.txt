This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 6): (3, 7), (4, 3): (4, 8), (2, 5): (2, 1), (1, 3): (1, 5), (4, 7): (4, 2), (4, 6): (4, 8), (2, 1): (2, 3), (0, 1): (0, 5), (7, 3): (7, 8), (5, 2): (5, 8), (3, 4): (3, 7), (7, 5): (7, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 5, 7, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
