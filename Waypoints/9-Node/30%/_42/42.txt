This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 6): (7, 7), (4, 6): (4, 5), (7, 5): (7, 6), (8, 4): (8, 0), (0, 1): (0, 4), (4, 7): (4, 8), (4, 0): (4, 1), (4, 3): (4, 8), (6, 4): (6, 3), (0, 4): (0, 5), (5, 8): (5, 2), (3, 6): (3, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 4, 2, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
