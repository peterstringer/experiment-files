This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 1): (5, 3), (5, 4): (5, 7), (7, 5): (7, 3), (7, 3): (7, 0), (7, 4): (7, 6), (4, 6): (4, 4), (8, 7): (8, 5), (2, 5): (2, 4), (6, 7): (6, 8), (3, 0): (3, 1), (0, 1): (0, 0), (6, 4): (6, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
