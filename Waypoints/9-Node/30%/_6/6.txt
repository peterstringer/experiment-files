This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 3): (4, 0), (6, 4): (6, 8), (4, 7): (4, 5), (7, 6): (7, 3), (5, 8): (5, 6), (3, 0): (3, 4), (4, 5): (4, 1), (3, 7): (3, 4), (5, 2): (5, 4), (3, 6): (3, 7), (6, 3): (6, 7), (7, 8): (7, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 2, 4, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
