This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 2): (4, 7), (4, 5): (4, 7), (2, 4): (2, 6), (7, 5): (7, 0), (8, 7): (8, 5), (6, 4): (6, 1), (6, 3): (6, 1), (0, 1): (0, 2), (4, 6): (4, 4), (1, 3): (1, 4), (7, 8): (7, 1), (7, 4): (7, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 7, 4, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
