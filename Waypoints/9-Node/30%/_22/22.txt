This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 0): (3, 4), (7, 4): (7, 2), (4, 5): (4, 1), (6, 3): (6, 2), (2, 4): (2, 6), (8, 5): (8, 0), (2, 1): (2, 8), (7, 6): (7, 4), (8, 7): (8, 4), (5, 7): (5, 3), (7, 5): (7, 8), (0, 4): (0, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 3, 7, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
