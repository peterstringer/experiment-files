This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 5): (2, 8), (4, 1): (4, 8), (5, 1): (5, 8), (7, 5): (7, 3), (5, 4): (5, 1), (1, 5): (1, 1), (7, 8): (7, 2), (6, 4): (6, 5), (5, 2): (5, 0), (7, 6): (7, 2), (4, 3): (4, 6), (1, 4): (1, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 7, 5, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
