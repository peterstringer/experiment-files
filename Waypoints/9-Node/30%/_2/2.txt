This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 5): (8, 0), (2, 4): (2, 5), (1, 5): (1, 4), (2, 1): (2, 0), (8, 4): (8, 6), (4, 6): (4, 8), (3, 7): (3, 6), (0, 4): (0, 0), (7, 6): (7, 2), (5, 8): (5, 1), (1, 3): (1, 0), (2, 5): (2, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 4, 7, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
