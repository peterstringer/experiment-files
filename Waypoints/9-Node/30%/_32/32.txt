This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 1): (2, 5), (4, 2): (4, 4), (1, 0): (1, 5), (4, 1): (4, 8), (8, 5): (8, 2), (1, 5): (1, 1), (4, 3): (4, 6), (2, 5): (2, 1), (4, 5): (4, 6), (7, 3): (7, 5), (3, 4): (3, 3), (5, 1): (5, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 4, 7, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
