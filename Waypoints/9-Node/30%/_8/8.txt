This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 4): (2, 8), (6, 7): (6, 3), (4, 5): (4, 8), (4, 8): (4, 0), (8, 5): (8, 0), (1, 3): (1, 6), (7, 6): (7, 0), (5, 8): (5, 4), (8, 4): (8, 1), (0, 3): (0, 4), (4, 7): (4, 0), (3, 0): (3, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 3, 2, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
