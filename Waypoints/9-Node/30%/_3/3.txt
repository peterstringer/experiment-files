This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 4): (7, 8), (0, 4): (0, 6), (3, 0): (3, 3), (4, 7): (4, 4), (5, 2): (5, 7), (1, 5): (1, 0), (4, 2): (4, 6), (1, 4): (1, 5), (6, 7): (6, 6), (4, 8): (4, 5), (8, 4): (8, 3), (3, 1): (3, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 4, 8, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
