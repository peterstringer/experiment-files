This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 1): (2, 0), (5, 4): (5, 2), (0, 1): (0, 2), (5, 1): (5, 7), (7, 5): (7, 2), (3, 0): (3, 7), (1, 0): (1, 3), (7, 3): (7, 0), (4, 0): (4, 5), (0, 3): (0, 1), (1, 3): (1, 5), (8, 5): (8, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 4, 7, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
