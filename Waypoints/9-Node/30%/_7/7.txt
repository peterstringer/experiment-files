This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 5): (7, 4), (4, 2): (4, 8), (1, 3): (1, 7), (1, 0): (1, 8), (7, 4): (7, 7), (3, 7): (3, 5), (5, 4): (5, 7), (2, 4): (2, 3), (7, 8): (7, 1), (6, 7): (6, 1), (4, 7): (4, 8), (4, 5): (4, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 6, 2, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
