This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 3): (4, 1), (4, 7): (4, 1), (5, 2): (5, 6), (8, 7): (8, 2), (8, 4): (8, 2), (4, 6): (4, 8), (2, 5): (2, 0), (4, 5): (4, 0), (7, 5): (7, 0), (1, 5): (1, 8), (4, 8): (4, 5), (4, 1): (4, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 5, 2, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
