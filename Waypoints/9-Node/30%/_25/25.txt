This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 5), (2, 4): (2, 2), (4, 3): (4, 4), (1, 3): (1, 8), (3, 0): (3, 8), (7, 6): (7, 3), (0, 3): (0, 8), (1, 5): (1, 6), (4, 2): (4, 7), (5, 7): (5, 5), (4, 7): (4, 6), (3, 6): (3, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 4, 1, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
