This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 5): (4, 3), (0, 3): (0, 5), (3, 1): (3, 0), (4, 2): (4, 5), (8, 7): (8, 4), (2, 4): (2, 7), (2, 1): (2, 3), (7, 6): (7, 1), (3, 6): (3, 3), (1, 3): (1, 8), (5, 7): (5, 6), (3, 0): (3, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 1, 2, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
