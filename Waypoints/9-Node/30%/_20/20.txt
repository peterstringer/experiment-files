This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 7), (7, 3): (7, 0), (1, 3): (1, 5), (3, 4): (3, 8), (2, 1): (2, 5), (4, 1): (4, 3), (1, 5): (1, 1), (7, 4): (7, 8), (3, 6): (3, 7), (0, 3): (0, 6), (4, 8): (4, 5), (8, 7): (8, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 8, 3, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
