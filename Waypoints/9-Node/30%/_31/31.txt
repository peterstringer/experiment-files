This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 5): (4, 1), (5, 2): (5, 6), (7, 3): (7, 6), (1, 0): (1, 5), (7, 4): (7, 2), (3, 4): (3, 6), (8, 7): (8, 8), (4, 0): (4, 4), (6, 4): (6, 5), (5, 8): (5, 4), (3, 6): (3, 0), (3, 1): (3, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 8, 5, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
