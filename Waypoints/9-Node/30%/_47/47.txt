This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 6): (7, 4), (2, 4): (2, 2), (5, 2): (5, 8), (1, 3): (1, 5), (6, 4): (6, 0), (4, 8): (4, 6), (2, 1): (2, 7), (6, 7): (6, 2), (1, 5): (1, 7), (8, 5): (8, 4), (4, 1): (4, 5), (1, 4): (1, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 7, 8, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
