This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 8), (4, 1): (4, 3), (1, 2): (1, 1), (8, 5): (8, 0), (8, 4): (8, 5), (7, 6): (7, 8), (0, 4): (0, 7), (5, 8): (5, 4), (5, 7): (5, 3), (6, 3): (6, 1), (4, 8): (4, 1), (1, 3): (1, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 1, 6, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
