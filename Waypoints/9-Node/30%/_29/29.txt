This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 4): (7, 5), (7, 3): (7, 8), (1, 4): (1, 1), (1, 2): (1, 7), (3, 6): (3, 3), (3, 7): (3, 0), (6, 3): (6, 1), (4, 0): (4, 2), (3, 1): (3, 2), (4, 7): (4, 6), (8, 7): (8, 4), (5, 7): (5, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 8, 4, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
