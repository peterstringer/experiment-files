This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 4): (1, 8), (2, 5): (2, 8), (1, 5): (1, 6), (6, 3): (6, 7), (5, 4): (5, 2), (5, 8): (5, 2), (3, 1): (3, 7), (5, 1): (5, 8), (8, 4): (8, 6), (7, 8): (7, 4), (7, 4): (7, 1), (2, 4): (2, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 5, 4, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
