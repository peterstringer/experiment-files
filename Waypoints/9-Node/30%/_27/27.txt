This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 5): (2, 3), (4, 2): (4, 7), (4, 7): (4, 1), (6, 7): (6, 6), (6, 4): (6, 0), (4, 6): (4, 0), (5, 2): (5, 3), (4, 0): (4, 7), (7, 8): (7, 0), (4, 5): (4, 3), (7, 6): (7, 0), (1, 4): (1, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 6, 3, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
