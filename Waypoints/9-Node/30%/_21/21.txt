This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 5): (1, 0), (4, 7): (4, 1), (3, 7): (3, 0), (8, 5): (8, 2), (8, 7): (8, 5), (4, 8): (4, 7), (7, 6): (7, 8), (7, 5): (7, 4), (5, 4): (5, 0), (2, 1): (2, 8), (4, 0): (4, 3), (1, 2): (1, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 2, 8, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
