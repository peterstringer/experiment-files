This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 2): (1, 0), (6, 4): (6, 3), (6, 7): (6, 8), (5, 7): (5, 1), (1, 3): (1, 1), (2, 1): (2, 4), (1, 5): (1, 6), (2, 4): (2, 5), (7, 8): (7, 5), (3, 4): (3, 8), (7, 6): (7, 0), (5, 4): (5, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 5, 4, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
