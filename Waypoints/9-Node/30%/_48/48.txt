This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 7): (4, 3), (3, 4): (3, 0), (5, 2): (5, 3), (2, 1): (2, 6), (4, 5): (4, 8), (4, 2): (4, 0), (3, 1): (3, 5), (1, 3): (1, 2), (4, 0): (4, 1), (1, 4): (1, 2), (3, 6): (3, 0), (2, 5): (2, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 3, 6, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
