This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 7): (4, 8), (7, 6): (7, 1), (5, 1): (5, 4), (1, 0): (1, 7), (2, 4): (2, 6), (1, 3): (1, 7), (4, 6): (4, 2), (2, 1): (2, 3), (5, 4): (5, 0), (3, 6): (3, 8), (5, 7): (5, 4), (1, 4): (1, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 5, 7, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
