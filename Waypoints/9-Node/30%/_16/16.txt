This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 8): (4, 6), (7, 4): (7, 7), (2, 5): (2, 8), (3, 7): (3, 1), (1, 0): (1, 3), (7, 8): (7, 5), (8, 5): (8, 2), (4, 6): (4, 1), (4, 7): (4, 0), (0, 4): (0, 2), (1, 2): (1, 7), (7, 5): (7, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 6, 4, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
