This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 0): (4, 8), (1, 3): (1, 1), (7, 5): (7, 1), (3, 4): (3, 0), (2, 5): (2, 0), (4, 7): (4, 6), (6, 4): (6, 3), (3, 7): (3, 3), (5, 1): (5, 2), (6, 3): (6, 8), (8, 4): (8, 8), (1, 5): (1, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 1, 3, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
