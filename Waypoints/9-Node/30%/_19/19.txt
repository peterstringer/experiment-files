This example has 9 nodes.
There are 12 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 6): (3, 3), (3, 7): (3, 0), (7, 6): (7, 0), (1, 0): (1, 4), (1, 4): (1, 2), (8, 5): (8, 0), (5, 4): (5, 2), (5, 7): (5, 2), (7, 8): (7, 0), (0, 3): (0, 0), (7, 5): (7, 4), (4, 3): (4, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 5, 3, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
