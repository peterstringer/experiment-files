This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 4): (2, 0), (6, 3): (6, 5), (4, 8): (4, 1), (1, 5): (1, 4), (8, 7): (8, 1), (3, 7): (3, 3), (4, 1): (4, 6), (0, 1): (0, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 5, 1, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
