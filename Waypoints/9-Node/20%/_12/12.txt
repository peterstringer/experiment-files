This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 7): (8, 2), (0, 4): (0, 0), (5, 7): (5, 2), (4, 7): (4, 2), (0, 3): (0, 6), (5, 2): (5, 4), (8, 5): (8, 3), (3, 0): (3, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
