This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 5), (1, 3): (1, 1), (5, 2): (5, 8), (4, 1): (4, 2), (1, 0): (1, 1), (4, 8): (4, 2), (4, 2): (4, 4), (7, 4): (7, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 3, 5, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
