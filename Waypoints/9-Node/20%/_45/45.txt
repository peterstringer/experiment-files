This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 7): (6, 1), (4, 1): (4, 3), (0, 1): (0, 0), (1, 3): (1, 1), (1, 2): (1, 1), (8, 7): (8, 8), (5, 7): (5, 2), (2, 4): (2, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 4, 3, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
