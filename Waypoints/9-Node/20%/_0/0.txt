This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 1): (2, 4), (5, 2): (5, 6), (1, 4): (1, 3), (8, 4): (8, 7), (4, 2): (4, 3), (3, 1): (3, 4), (6, 3): (6, 0), (5, 4): (5, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 8, 1, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
