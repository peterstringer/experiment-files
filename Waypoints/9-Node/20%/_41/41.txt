This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 8): (7, 1), (7, 3): (7, 1), (2, 5): (2, 3), (6, 4): (6, 5), (8, 7): (8, 1), (1, 4): (1, 6), (4, 0): (4, 4), (1, 3): (1, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 3, 7, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
