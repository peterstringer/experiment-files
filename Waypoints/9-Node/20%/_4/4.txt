This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 5), (1, 0): (1, 8), (6, 3): (6, 2), (7, 4): (7, 3), (8, 5): (8, 7), (5, 8): (5, 1), (3, 7): (3, 5), (4, 8): (4, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 2, 4, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
