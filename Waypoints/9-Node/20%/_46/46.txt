This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 4): (7, 8), (5, 8): (5, 0), (4, 3): (4, 6), (0, 4): (0, 1), (1, 3): (1, 1), (6, 7): (6, 6), (1, 0): (1, 1), (3, 1): (3, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 8, 2, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
