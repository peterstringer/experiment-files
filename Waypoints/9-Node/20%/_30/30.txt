This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 4): (0, 2), (5, 2): (5, 7), (4, 3): (4, 2), (3, 7): (3, 5), (0, 1): (0, 6), (7, 6): (7, 1), (1, 3): (1, 5), (4, 7): (4, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 1, 3, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
