This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 7): (5, 2), (2, 1): (2, 4), (4, 0): (4, 5), (2, 4): (2, 6), (0, 3): (0, 5), (3, 4): (3, 8), (4, 1): (4, 6), (4, 7): (4, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 2, 1, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
