This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 1): (4, 6), (4, 6): (4, 2), (2, 4): (2, 8), (5, 1): (5, 2), (3, 4): (3, 6), (4, 3): (4, 4), (2, 5): (2, 8), (1, 4): (1, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 1, 5, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
