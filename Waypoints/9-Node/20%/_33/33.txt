This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 7): (5, 3), (4, 8): (4, 5), (1, 5): (1, 1), (7, 5): (7, 0), (7, 3): (7, 7), (4, 2): (4, 4), (4, 6): (4, 2), (6, 4): (6, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 2, 6, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
