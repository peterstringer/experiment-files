This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 3): (7, 6), (5, 2): (5, 6), (4, 0): (4, 8), (6, 4): (6, 3), (8, 4): (8, 7), (7, 8): (7, 3), (4, 1): (4, 8), (7, 6): (7, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 7, 2, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
