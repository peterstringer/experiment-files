This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 2): (4, 8), (7, 3): (7, 7), (8, 7): (8, 4), (1, 4): (1, 3), (2, 4): (2, 6), (6, 4): (6, 7), (3, 1): (3, 2), (2, 1): (2, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 4, 8, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
