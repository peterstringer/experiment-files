This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 3): (1, 1), (6, 4): (6, 8), (4, 0): (4, 3), (2, 1): (2, 0), (0, 3): (0, 8), (4, 6): (4, 1), (6, 3): (6, 6), (5, 4): (5, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 1, 6, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
