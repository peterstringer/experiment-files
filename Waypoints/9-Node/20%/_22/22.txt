This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 3): (6, 4), (3, 4): (3, 7), (3, 1): (3, 3), (1, 0): (1, 5), (4, 6): (4, 4), (0, 1): (0, 6), (6, 7): (6, 5), (3, 6): (3, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 1, 6, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
