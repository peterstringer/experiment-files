This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 4): (5, 2), (5, 7): (5, 1), (5, 8): (5, 3), (5, 2): (5, 0), (1, 3): (1, 2), (7, 6): (7, 7), (8, 4): (8, 2), (2, 5): (2, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 5, 2, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
