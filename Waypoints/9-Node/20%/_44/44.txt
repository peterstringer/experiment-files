This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 8): (7, 7), (0, 1): (0, 8), (5, 7): (5, 0), (7, 3): (7, 2), (2, 4): (2, 0), (4, 1): (4, 7), (8, 4): (8, 7), (5, 4): (5, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 6, 4, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
