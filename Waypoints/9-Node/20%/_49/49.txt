This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 4): (0, 0), (3, 4): (3, 5), (4, 6): (4, 4), (7, 3): (7, 8), (2, 1): (2, 6), (1, 0): (1, 6), (3, 0): (3, 2), (4, 2): (4, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 7, 2, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
