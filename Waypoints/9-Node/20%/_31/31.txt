This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 5): (1, 1), (5, 1): (5, 7), (6, 4): (6, 7), (8, 4): (8, 2), (0, 3): (0, 0), (8, 5): (8, 6), (4, 3): (4, 5), (4, 2): (4, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 2, 5, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
