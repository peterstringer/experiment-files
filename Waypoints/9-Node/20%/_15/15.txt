This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 5): (1, 4), (4, 1): (4, 5), (5, 4): (5, 3), (7, 6): (7, 8), (7, 3): (7, 6), (4, 7): (4, 4), (5, 2): (5, 0), (4, 3): (4, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 3, 8, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
