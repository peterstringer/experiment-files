This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 4): (2, 5), (5, 4): (5, 6), (8, 4): (8, 7), (4, 7): (4, 1), (5, 1): (5, 8), (7, 3): (7, 5), (1, 2): (1, 8), (3, 0): (3, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 1, 3, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
