This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 1): (3, 0), (8, 4): (8, 3), (4, 8): (4, 0), (0, 4): (0, 7), (5, 7): (5, 4), (3, 7): (3, 2), (3, 6): (3, 5), (2, 5): (2, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 3, 1, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
