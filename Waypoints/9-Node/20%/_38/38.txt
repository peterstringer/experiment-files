This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 4): (1, 2), (4, 2): (4, 0), (4, 3): (4, 4), (7, 4): (7, 2), (8, 7): (8, 5), (5, 7): (5, 1), (7, 8): (7, 5), (6, 3): (6, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 4, 1, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
