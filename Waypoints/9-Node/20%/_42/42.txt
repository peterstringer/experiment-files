This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 4): (7, 7), (3, 4): (3, 0), (7, 3): (7, 2), (8, 5): (8, 7), (8, 4): (8, 7), (3, 1): (3, 2), (8, 7): (8, 6), (5, 4): (5, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 7, 6, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
