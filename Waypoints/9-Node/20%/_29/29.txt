This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 1): (3, 8), (0, 4): (0, 6), (1, 2): (1, 5), (1, 5): (1, 1), (5, 7): (5, 8), (7, 6): (7, 3), (2, 4): (2, 1), (0, 1): (0, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 7, 5, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
