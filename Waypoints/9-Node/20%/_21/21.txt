This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 1): (0, 4), (4, 0): (4, 2), (4, 7): (4, 3), (7, 4): (7, 6), (5, 2): (5, 7), (5, 8): (5, 3), (7, 6): (7, 3), (5, 4): (5, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 3, 1, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
