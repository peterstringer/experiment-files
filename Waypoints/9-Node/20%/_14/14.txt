This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 2): (4, 5), (3, 7): (3, 0), (4, 5): (4, 4), (1, 3): (1, 6), (2, 4): (2, 0), (5, 1): (5, 5), (7, 3): (7, 5), (1, 0): (1, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 6, 8, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
