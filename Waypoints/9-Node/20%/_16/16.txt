This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 4): (5, 2), (4, 1): (4, 6), (0, 3): (0, 4), (5, 8): (5, 6), (8, 4): (8, 0), (5, 1): (5, 2), (1, 3): (1, 5), (1, 4): (1, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 4, 3, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
