This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 3): (6, 7), (8, 4): (8, 7), (2, 4): (2, 2), (0, 3): (0, 7), (1, 5): (1, 4), (5, 1): (5, 0), (7, 5): (7, 7), (4, 8): (4, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 5, 6, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
