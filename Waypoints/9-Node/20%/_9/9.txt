This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 5), (1, 5): (1, 3), (8, 7): (8, 4), (5, 1): (5, 2), (0, 1): (0, 4), (2, 5): (2, 2), (2, 1): (2, 0), (7, 3): (7, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 8, 5, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
