This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 0): (4, 7), (1, 5): (1, 0), (0, 3): (0, 8), (1, 0): (1, 3), (3, 1): (3, 4), (4, 2): (4, 5), (6, 3): (6, 1), (5, 8): (5, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 4, 1, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
