This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 8): (7, 0), (5, 1): (5, 0), (8, 4): (8, 6), (4, 1): (4, 7), (1, 3): (1, 7), (4, 0): (4, 2), (7, 3): (7, 6), (4, 7): (4, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 7, 3, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
