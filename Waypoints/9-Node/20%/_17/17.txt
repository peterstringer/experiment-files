This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 0): (1, 4), (5, 8): (5, 3), (7, 5): (7, 1), (4, 3): (4, 6), (3, 7): (3, 4), (4, 0): (4, 8), (2, 1): (2, 4), (4, 1): (4, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 7, 5, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
