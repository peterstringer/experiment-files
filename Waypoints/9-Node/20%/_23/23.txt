This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 8): (5, 0), (3, 0): (3, 7), (5, 1): (5, 4), (6, 3): (6, 1), (1, 4): (1, 5), (8, 4): (8, 6), (3, 7): (3, 8), (6, 4): (6, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 5, 8, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
