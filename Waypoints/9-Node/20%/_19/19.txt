This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 3): (0, 0), (7, 3): (7, 6), (6, 3): (6, 8), (4, 8): (4, 2), (4, 3): (4, 7), (5, 7): (5, 5), (4, 2): (4, 5), (3, 4): (3, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 3, 1, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
