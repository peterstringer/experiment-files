This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 0): (1, 7), (3, 4): (3, 1), (8, 5): (8, 4), (6, 4): (6, 5), (2, 1): (2, 8), (7, 4): (7, 8), (4, 5): (4, 0), (4, 3): (4, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 3, 2, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
