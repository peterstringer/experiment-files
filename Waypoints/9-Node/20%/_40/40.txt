This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 3): (6, 1), (6, 4): (6, 6), (1, 0): (1, 3), (4, 1): (4, 3), (8, 5): (8, 8), (5, 2): (5, 5), (0, 4): (0, 5), (7, 8): (7, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 4, 2, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
