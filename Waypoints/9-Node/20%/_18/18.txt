This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 4): (2, 5), (1, 4): (1, 7), (4, 3): (4, 0), (5, 2): (5, 6), (8, 4): (8, 2), (2, 5): (2, 3), (4, 8): (4, 7), (7, 5): (7, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 6, 3, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
