This example has 9 nodes.
There are 8 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 4): (0, 1), (4, 2): (4, 1), (3, 0): (3, 2), (3, 7): (3, 8), (6, 3): (6, 7), (0, 3): (0, 8), (5, 2): (5, 6), (6, 4): (6, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
