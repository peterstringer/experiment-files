This example has 9 nodes.
There are 24 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 7): (3, 0), (3, 0): (3, 6), (5, 2): (5, 4), (6, 4): (6, 3), (4, 0): (4, 3), (7, 4): (7, 3), (1, 5): (1, 6), (7, 3): (7, 8), (1, 2): (1, 3), (3, 6): (3, 8), (2, 1): (2, 0), (8, 7): (8, 8), (4, 7): (4, 5), (4, 1): (4, 7), (8, 4): (8, 8), (2, 4): (2, 6), (4, 3): (4, 0), (6, 7): (6, 3), (4, 8): (4, 5), (1, 4): (1, 3), (1, 0): (1, 4), (4, 6): (4, 3), (5, 7): (5, 3), (3, 4): (3, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 1, 8, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
