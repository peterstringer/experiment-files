This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 1): (2, 0), (6, 4): (6, 7), (5, 7): (5, 8), (6, 3): (6, 7), (7, 4): (7, 1), (1, 2): (1, 8), (5, 8): (5, 1), (5, 2): (5, 1), (1, 3): (1, 6), (4, 1): (4, 5), (8, 4): (8, 1), (0, 1): (0, 4), (7, 8): (7, 5), (7, 6): (7, 8), (7, 5): (7, 4), (2, 5): (2, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 6, 7, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
