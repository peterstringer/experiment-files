This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 3): (7, 2), (3, 1): (3, 5), (0, 4): (0, 2), (7, 6): (7, 3), (2, 5): (2, 7), (4, 6): (4, 1), (5, 1): (5, 2), (6, 3): (6, 8), (4, 0): (4, 6), (7, 5): (7, 1), (5, 2): (5, 5), (3, 4): (3, 0), (3, 7): (3, 8), (2, 4): (2, 7), (2, 1): (2, 3), (4, 2): (4, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 4, 7, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
