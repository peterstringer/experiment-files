This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 7): (8, 3), (7, 4): (7, 5), (5, 8): (5, 0), (7, 8): (7, 6), (4, 5): (4, 2), (6, 3): (6, 8), (1, 0): (1, 8), (3, 4): (3, 3), (4, 0): (4, 7), (7, 3): (7, 1), (5, 1): (5, 5), (1, 3): (1, 5), (8, 5): (8, 4), (1, 2): (1, 4), (0, 3): (0, 7), (3, 1): (3, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 2, 7, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
