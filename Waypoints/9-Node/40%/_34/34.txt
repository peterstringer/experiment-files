This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 7): (6, 1), (4, 2): (4, 0), (1, 4): (1, 7), (2, 4): (2, 0), (7, 8): (7, 3), (7, 4): (7, 7), (7, 5): (7, 2), (1, 5): (1, 7), (4, 7): (4, 6), (6, 4): (6, 1), (8, 7): (8, 1), (5, 2): (5, 6), (3, 4): (3, 2), (3, 6): (3, 7), (5, 7): (5, 4), (1, 2): (1, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 8, 3, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
