This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 4): (3, 7), (1, 4): (1, 5), (7, 3): (7, 6), (3, 7): (3, 3), (5, 4): (5, 2), (8, 4): (8, 8), (4, 1): (4, 2), (0, 3): (0, 8), (2, 4): (2, 3), (3, 1): (3, 7), (7, 6): (7, 2), (6, 3): (6, 0), (4, 3): (4, 0), (4, 7): (4, 5), (4, 5): (4, 3), (2, 5): (2, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 6, 8, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
