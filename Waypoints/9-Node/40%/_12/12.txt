This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 4): (8, 7), (1, 2): (1, 5), (5, 1): (5, 7), (3, 6): (3, 3), (2, 1): (2, 6), (6, 4): (6, 6), (3, 1): (3, 7), (7, 8): (7, 7), (3, 7): (3, 5), (3, 4): (3, 0), (6, 3): (6, 0), (4, 3): (4, 0), (5, 7): (5, 0), (4, 8): (4, 0), (7, 4): (7, 7), (3, 0): (3, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 2, 5, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
