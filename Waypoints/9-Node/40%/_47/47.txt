This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 0): (4, 4), (1, 4): (1, 8), (0, 3): (0, 0), (4, 6): (4, 8), (4, 1): (4, 2), (3, 4): (3, 7), (5, 4): (5, 3), (3, 1): (3, 0), (6, 4): (6, 7), (8, 5): (8, 3), (7, 4): (7, 1), (1, 0): (1, 5), (8, 4): (8, 7), (6, 7): (6, 4), (7, 3): (7, 5), (2, 4): (2, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 4, 7, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
