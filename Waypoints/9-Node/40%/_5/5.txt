This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 8): (7, 6), (7, 5): (7, 8), (1, 0): (1, 1), (7, 4): (7, 6), (7, 6): (7, 3), (2, 4): (2, 3), (4, 8): (4, 5), (4, 7): (4, 0), (4, 0): (4, 5), (0, 4): (0, 8), (4, 3): (4, 4), (1, 5): (1, 3), (5, 2): (5, 6), (4, 1): (4, 7), (6, 4): (6, 2), (3, 0): (3, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 2, 8, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
