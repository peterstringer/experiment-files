This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 3): (0, 5), (8, 5): (8, 8), (8, 7): (8, 5), (5, 7): (5, 1), (2, 4): (2, 3), (1, 2): (1, 6), (1, 0): (1, 5), (1, 5): (1, 4), (6, 7): (6, 3), (4, 3): (4, 7), (8, 4): (8, 6), (7, 6): (7, 4), (7, 3): (7, 0), (4, 5): (4, 6), (7, 4): (7, 6), (0, 4): (0, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 6, 3, 8, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
