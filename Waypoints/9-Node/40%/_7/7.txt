This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 6): (7, 5), (4, 6): (4, 4), (1, 0): (1, 6), (8, 4): (8, 3), (2, 1): (2, 3), (2, 4): (2, 0), (4, 5): (4, 7), (6, 3): (6, 2), (0, 3): (0, 2), (5, 4): (5, 2), (7, 4): (7, 7), (2, 5): (2, 1), (8, 7): (8, 5), (3, 1): (3, 2), (1, 4): (1, 5), (4, 3): (4, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 4, 8, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
