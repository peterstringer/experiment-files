This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 6): (4, 2), (7, 8): (7, 4), (4, 3): (4, 6), (6, 7): (6, 2), (8, 4): (8, 1), (4, 1): (4, 8), (5, 4): (5, 5), (2, 4): (2, 0), (7, 4): (7, 2), (6, 3): (6, 8), (7, 5): (7, 0), (1, 4): (1, 6), (4, 2): (4, 7), (4, 8): (4, 6), (5, 1): (5, 2), (0, 4): (0, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 5, 6, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
