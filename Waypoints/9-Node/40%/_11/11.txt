This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 0): (4, 7), (4, 2): (4, 7), (4, 8): (4, 5), (5, 4): (5, 8), (2, 4): (2, 8), (4, 5): (4, 3), (5, 1): (5, 5), (5, 2): (5, 7), (0, 3): (0, 0), (1, 0): (1, 5), (8, 4): (8, 8), (3, 0): (3, 7), (6, 3): (6, 6), (3, 1): (3, 2), (4, 6): (4, 8), (1, 3): (1, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 3, 5, 2, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
