This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 8): (5, 2), (4, 0): (4, 7), (2, 5): (2, 0), (0, 4): (0, 7), (3, 4): (3, 3), (0, 3): (0, 6), (6, 4): (6, 2), (4, 3): (4, 2), (6, 7): (6, 0), (4, 5): (4, 8), (2, 1): (2, 6), (6, 3): (6, 5), (3, 6): (3, 1), (5, 4): (5, 7), (1, 0): (1, 7), (1, 3): (1, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 5, 8, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
