This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 8): (5, 0), (3, 1): (3, 4), (7, 3): (7, 2), (5, 7): (5, 1), (2, 4): (2, 8), (6, 7): (6, 8), (7, 8): (7, 3), (7, 6): (7, 1), (4, 0): (4, 3), (7, 5): (7, 2), (3, 6): (3, 3), (1, 0): (1, 4), (4, 5): (4, 0), (8, 4): (8, 0), (4, 1): (4, 4), (0, 4): (0, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 3, 7, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
