This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 7): (6, 5), (4, 3): (4, 4), (5, 2): (5, 8), (4, 8): (4, 2), (3, 6): (3, 3), (4, 0): (4, 8), (3, 0): (3, 5), (1, 3): (1, 4), (4, 5): (4, 8), (1, 5): (1, 0), (7, 6): (7, 7), (4, 2): (4, 1), (6, 4): (6, 6), (8, 7): (8, 1), (4, 7): (4, 0), (7, 3): (7, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 4, 6, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
