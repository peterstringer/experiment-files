This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 1): (2, 8), (4, 0): (4, 1), (4, 7): (4, 6), (4, 2): (4, 7), (7, 6): (7, 4), (2, 4): (2, 7), (7, 8): (7, 5), (5, 8): (5, 1), (3, 1): (3, 4), (8, 7): (8, 0), (8, 4): (8, 1), (4, 5): (4, 4), (1, 4): (1, 0), (1, 2): (1, 0), (2, 5): (2, 2), (3, 0): (3, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 6, 3, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
