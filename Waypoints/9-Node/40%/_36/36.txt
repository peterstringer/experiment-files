This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(6, 3): (6, 4), (7, 5): (7, 3), (4, 8): (4, 0), (8, 4): (8, 3), (1, 5): (1, 4), (5, 7): (5, 0), (0, 3): (0, 5), (3, 7): (3, 0), (4, 3): (4, 7), (6, 4): (6, 1), (1, 0): (1, 7), (4, 6): (4, 7), (4, 2): (4, 8), (1, 4): (1, 1), (2, 1): (2, 2), (7, 4): (7, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 2, 3, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
