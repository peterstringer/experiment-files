This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 6): (7, 2), (3, 7): (3, 6), (5, 1): (5, 7), (6, 3): (6, 0), (2, 4): (2, 6), (7, 8): (7, 4), (0, 4): (0, 8), (4, 8): (4, 2), (4, 5): (4, 7), (5, 8): (5, 7), (3, 4): (3, 2), (7, 3): (7, 5), (8, 5): (8, 0), (4, 0): (4, 5), (3, 0): (3, 6), (4, 1): (4, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 1, 5, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
