This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 4): (8, 8), (6, 7): (6, 0), (7, 3): (7, 0), (1, 2): (1, 0), (4, 2): (4, 6), (2, 5): (2, 4), (8, 7): (8, 1), (4, 7): (4, 5), (1, 0): (1, 2), (4, 6): (4, 8), (3, 6): (3, 4), (5, 2): (5, 5), (6, 4): (6, 0), (7, 4): (7, 3), (1, 4): (1, 2), (0, 3): (0, 4)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 1, 4, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
