This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 6): (3, 5), (4, 7): (4, 2), (8, 4): (8, 1), (4, 3): (4, 8), (4, 5): (4, 1), (7, 4): (7, 0), (4, 0): (4, 1), (7, 6): (7, 2), (3, 4): (3, 0), (5, 4): (5, 8), (5, 2): (5, 6), (6, 7): (6, 3), (2, 5): (2, 8), (5, 8): (5, 1), (6, 3): (6, 8), (1, 2): (1, 5)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 6, 2, 1]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
