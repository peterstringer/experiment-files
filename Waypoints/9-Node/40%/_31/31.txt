This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 2): (4, 3), (5, 1): (5, 3), (1, 0): (1, 4), (0, 3): (0, 1), (3, 4): (3, 1), (6, 3): (6, 1), (5, 7): (5, 5), (6, 4): (6, 2), (1, 5): (1, 4), (8, 5): (8, 0), (4, 6): (4, 4), (4, 5): (4, 3), (0, 1): (0, 3), (8, 7): (8, 0), (4, 1): (4, 4), (2, 5): (2, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 2, 8, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
