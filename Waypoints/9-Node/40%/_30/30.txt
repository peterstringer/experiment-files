This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 7): (8, 8), (6, 7): (6, 4), (7, 5): (7, 8), (4, 3): (4, 8), (5, 2): (5, 0), (5, 7): (5, 3), (2, 4): (2, 1), (4, 7): (4, 2), (8, 5): (8, 3), (4, 1): (4, 8), (5, 1): (5, 6), (8, 4): (8, 6), (7, 8): (7, 2), (6, 3): (6, 7), (3, 4): (3, 5), (4, 0): (4, 8)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 2, 3, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
