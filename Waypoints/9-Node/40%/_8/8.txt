This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(5, 2): (5, 1), (1, 0): (1, 7), (6, 3): (6, 7), (3, 4): (3, 6), (7, 4): (7, 2), (7, 8): (7, 1), (3, 1): (3, 6), (5, 4): (5, 7), (7, 5): (7, 3), (1, 2): (1, 0), (4, 0): (4, 6), (2, 1): (2, 7), (5, 7): (5, 4), (6, 4): (6, 7), (1, 5): (1, 6), (1, 3): (1, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 7, 1, 2, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(3)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
