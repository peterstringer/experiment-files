This example has 9 nodes.
There are 16 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 1): (0, 8), (2, 4): (2, 7), (5, 8): (5, 0), (4, 8): (4, 6), (4, 0): (4, 1), (8, 7): (8, 6), (1, 5): (1, 4), (5, 4): (5, 0), (7, 3): (7, 4), (4, 6): (4, 7), (5, 1): (5, 7), (2, 1): (2, 2), (4, 2): (4, 3), (7, 6): (7, 5), (2, 5): (2, 7), (4, 3): (4, 2)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 5, 4, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
