This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(1, 2): (1, 1), (4, 6): (4, 3), (2, 1): (2, 3), (7, 3): (7, 5), (7, 4): (7, 6), (6, 7): (6, 6), (5, 8): (5, 7), (6, 4): (6, 3), (4, 0): (4, 7), (7, 8): (7, 1), (1, 0): (1, 3), (4, 5): (4, 8), (5, 7): (5, 6), (0, 1): (0, 4), (6, 3): (6, 4), (5, 4): (5, 0), (3, 0): (3, 4), (4, 3): (4, 7), (4, 7): (4, 5), (7, 6): (7, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 5, 6, 7]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
