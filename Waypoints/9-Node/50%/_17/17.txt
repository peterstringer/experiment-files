This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 5): (2, 0), (1, 0): (1, 6), (4, 6): (4, 5), (3, 1): (3, 2), (7, 5): (7, 8), (2, 4): (2, 3), (4, 2): (4, 6), (8, 5): (8, 2), (7, 6): (7, 7), (4, 8): (4, 2), (6, 3): (6, 6), (4, 3): (4, 8), (8, 7): (8, 5), (1, 4): (1, 8), (7, 3): (7, 8), (1, 5): (1, 3), (2, 1): (2, 7), (6, 4): (6, 3), (5, 2): (5, 1), (7, 4): (7, 3)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 4, 1, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
