This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(2, 4): (2, 3), (7, 6): (7, 3), (5, 8): (5, 3), (5, 1): (5, 0), (1, 5): (1, 2), (4, 1): (4, 5), (5, 4): (5, 8), (4, 5): (4, 6), (8, 7): (8, 8), (1, 3): (1, 5), (7, 8): (7, 4), (3, 0): (3, 5), (7, 3): (7, 4), (6, 3): (6, 5), (4, 7): (4, 0), (1, 4): (1, 0), (4, 2): (4, 6), (2, 5): (2, 7), (0, 3): (0, 2), (5, 7): (5, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 4, 7, 1, 3]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
