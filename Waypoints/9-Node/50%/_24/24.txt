This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(7, 5): (7, 1), (5, 7): (5, 3), (1, 4): (1, 5), (8, 5): (8, 2), (1, 2): (1, 5), (2, 1): (2, 7), (7, 3): (7, 8), (4, 2): (4, 1), (7, 8): (7, 5), (6, 4): (6, 1), (2, 5): (2, 3), (2, 4): (2, 8), (3, 1): (3, 5), (1, 3): (1, 4), (1, 0): (1, 7), (7, 6): (7, 8), (3, 6): (3, 0), (4, 8): (4, 2), (1, 5): (1, 3), (4, 1): (4, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 3, 5, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
