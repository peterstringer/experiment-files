This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 8): (4, 3), (5, 4): (5, 7), (4, 5): (4, 4), (7, 8): (7, 4), (4, 0): (4, 3), (2, 5): (2, 7), (3, 4): (3, 7), (4, 3): (4, 6), (6, 3): (6, 0), (8, 4): (8, 2), (5, 2): (5, 8), (5, 1): (5, 3), (8, 5): (8, 8), (0, 3): (0, 6), (7, 4): (7, 6), (2, 4): (2, 2), (1, 0): (1, 4), (2, 1): (2, 7), (3, 7): (3, 5), (4, 6): (4, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 3, 6, 4]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], +!at(3)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
