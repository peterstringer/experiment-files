This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(0, 3): (0, 0), (7, 5): (7, 8), (6, 3): (6, 6), (5, 8): (5, 3), (4, 6): (4, 4), (2, 4): (2, 5), (4, 5): (4, 1), (4, 0): (4, 3), (3, 4): (3, 7), (5, 1): (5, 5), (8, 5): (8, 3), (8, 7): (8, 3), (4, 7): (4, 2), (8, 4): (8, 1), (7, 6): (7, 4), (7, 3): (7, 2), (4, 3): (4, 6), (1, 4): (1, 2), (3, 7): (3, 8), (0, 1): (0, 7)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 1, 8, 4, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
