This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 4): (8, 3), (2, 1): (2, 5), (7, 6): (7, 3), (4, 3): (4, 1), (4, 8): (4, 1), (3, 0): (3, 5), (4, 0): (4, 7), (4, 6): (4, 5), (6, 7): (6, 1), (4, 1): (4, 6), (3, 4): (3, 5), (3, 6): (3, 0), (7, 4): (7, 7), (5, 7): (5, 3), (2, 5): (2, 2), (6, 4): (6, 7), (8, 5): (8, 3), (2, 4): (2, 3), (3, 1): (3, 7), (1, 4): (1, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 7, 6, 2]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
