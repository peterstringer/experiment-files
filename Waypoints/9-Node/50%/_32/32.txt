This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(4, 5): (4, 3), (5, 1): (5, 0), (7, 3): (7, 4), (1, 2): (1, 6), (1, 0): (1, 1), (4, 8): (4, 4), (5, 8): (5, 4), (3, 4): (3, 7), (2, 4): (2, 7), (6, 4): (6, 3), (2, 1): (2, 6), (7, 5): (7, 6), (1, 3): (1, 7), (3, 7): (3, 4), (7, 4): (7, 0), (6, 7): (6, 2), (7, 6): (7, 5), (1, 4): (1, 3), (4, 2): (4, 3), (6, 3): (6, 1)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 2, 7, 4, 8]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
