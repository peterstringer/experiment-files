This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(8, 7): (8, 5), (5, 8): (5, 3), (4, 0): (4, 6), (4, 8): (4, 4), (3, 1): (3, 8), (3, 0): (3, 1), (5, 2): (5, 8), (2, 1): (2, 0), (4, 5): (4, 4), (4, 6): (4, 1), (7, 5): (7, 3), (5, 7): (5, 5), (8, 5): (8, 2), (1, 4): (1, 3), (4, 2): (4, 4), (6, 4): (6, 6), (7, 8): (7, 5), (1, 3): (1, 5), (6, 3): (6, 1), (4, 7): (4, 0)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 8, 1, 2, 5]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(4)[perform], +!at(8)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(5)[perform], +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(2)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
