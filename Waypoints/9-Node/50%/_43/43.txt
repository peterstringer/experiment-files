This example has 9 nodes.
There are 20 failing action(s) pairs: 
{(3, 7): (3, 1), (7, 6): (7, 7), (3, 0): (3, 7), (6, 4): (6, 2), (7, 3): (7, 6), (1, 3): (1, 0), (5, 4): (5, 2), (2, 5): (2, 7), (3, 6): (3, 5), (5, 8): (5, 0), (4, 1): (4, 5), (4, 3): (4, 7), (3, 4): (3, 7), (7, 5): (7, 3), (4, 0): (4, 1), (1, 2): (1, 3), (3, 1): (3, 3), (5, 1): (5, 7), (2, 1): (2, 5), (8, 5): (8, 6)}

The agent should navigate through checkpoints: 
[0, 5, 1, 7, 6]

Using the route plan: 
+!at(1)[perform], +!at(5)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 1"), +!at(1)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 2"), +!at(4)[perform], +!at(7)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 3"), +!at(6)[perform], print("Visited Checkpoint 4")
